# cbennell.com

This is the static content generator for [cbennell.com](https://cbennell.com), my personal website and blog.

This site is powered by [Bridgetown](https://www.bridgetownrb.com/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), deployed with [Kamal](https://kamal-deploy.org/).

It's mostly a vanilla Bridgetown site, but one point of interest is the custom code block generator.

## Commands

```sh
# running locally
bin/bridgetown start

# build & deploy to production
bin/kamal deploy

# load the site up within a Ruby console (IRB)
bin/bridgetown console
```
